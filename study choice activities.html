        <hr>
        <p>
            Over here I will talk about how I ended up doing this ICT course. After I quit my Japanese course on the
            Universiteit Leiden, I was pretty lost. At that time I was completely blank on what I wanted to do next
            . The most common thing almost-to-be students do is make a profession test so I decided to try a couple of
            them. The results were as I thought: useless.
            Since profession tests didn't work out, I had to come up with something else that would send me on the right
            track on making a course decision. When you
            don't know the answer to a question, why not try gathering other's people's answers?
        </p>

        <p> As expected many people told me to use profession websites. My mom even suggested to visit a person who will
            get to know you and will point you in the right direction for a profession.
            At some point I found a website where they mentioned a similar method. You had to make many online tests
            about your personality and what you like etc.
            Based on that, you would get a couple course options that might match. The answers I got were mostly
            pointing to IT-courses with design.
            I'm not interested in design so I went to look for options where design wasn't a very big part of the
            course. That's when I came on this course.I watched quite a bit of videos about this course and the school. 
            ICT is a very broad course and you can learn a lot of valueable things that wil be valuable for a long time in many parts
            of the world. I wondered if the computer language would interest me as much as normal languages.
        </p>

        <p>When im done with this course, I would like to work at a game company or make websites for people's websites.
        It would be fun to see the company and your college's being happy about what you created together.
